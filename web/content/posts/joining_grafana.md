I'm super excited to join [Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/) as a software engineer. 

Grafana Labs has been a company i've admired ever since I learned about cloud-native development and open source.  

Apparently, this is my first full-time role and so, it automaticially marks the beginning of my career in software engineering.

Thankful for all the amazing software engineers- [Bartek](https://www.bwplotka.dev/), [Lucas](https://github.com/squat), and the entire [Thanos](https://thanos.io/) maintainers -that has helped me become a better human.    

My goal is to learn, build, and write as much as I can, thus, I'll be using this blog a lot which is great!    

I look forward to working with amazing people, building new tools, and contributing to the growth of the company.

Thanks for reading! ðŸ¤—
