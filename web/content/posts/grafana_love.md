I just logged on to Twitter to check what's happening on my timeline and to know if I would find anything that will make me laugh- Twitter peeps, y'all make my day ;P

Scrolling down the timeline, I saw this post about Grafana. It says, "I Love Grafana". At that point, I paused scrolling and took some time to reflect on that statement.

Now, just to give you a little background story to who I am as a person, I've never fallen in love before. I hear people sing, write, and talk about it but I don't really know how it feels like to fall in love with something. I imagined feelings such as Love must have come from a very special place and proclaiming it means you've developed a very deep connection with whatever you're loving.

I assume the definition of Love to be having a great interest and pleasure in something and in the case of Grafana, I think I'm beginning to fall in love with the open source project.

I've always had a value-driven mentality and that has massively influenced the choices I make in life. Joining a company such as Grafana Labs gives me the opportunity to make a long-lasting, positive impact on millions of users and working in a company that resonates with my personal values makes me alot more interested in the day-to-day activities, as well as it's projects.

"I Love Grafana" might sound as a promotional advert when it comes from an employee, but seeing this statement proclaimed by users gives me this great conviction that Grafana Labs truly cares about the community, and vice versa.

I hope we continue to build a project that we and the community loves.
